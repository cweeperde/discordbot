# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** 12.11.2025

## 1. Introduction  
These Terms of Service ("ToS") govern your use of the Discord bot, which provides utility and moderation features for servers. By using the bot, you agree to comply with these terms. If you do not agree, please refrain from using it.

## 2. Purpose of the Bot  
The bot is designed to assist with server moderation and provide various utility features. It allows server owners to automate tasks, manage user roles, and moderate.

## 3. User Eligibility  
There are no restrictions on who can use this bot's service. The bot is accessible to all users within Discord servers where it has been added.

## 4. Data Collection  
The bot collects certain user and server data necessary for moderation and utility functions. Please read the Privacy Policy for more information on that.
This data is used to moderate channels, manage user roles, and save server-specific settings. **The bot does not store any user messages itself**, even if offensive language moderation is enabled. Messages might still be logged or saved inside of discord channels.

## 5. User Content  
When offensive language moderation or logging is enabled, the bot will scan messages in real time for inappropriate content. However, no messages are saved by the bot itself.

## 6. Usage Restrictions  
To ensure a positive experience for all users, the following actions are prohibited:
- Abusing any APIs integrated into botanaki
- Spamming commands excessively
- Engaging in behavior that disrupts the normal use of the bot

The owner of the bot may suspend its functionalities for users or servers that engage in such activities.

## 7. Monetization  
We do not offer any paid features or services. All functionalities are available for free, and there will be no future paid upgrades.

## 8. Liability  
The bot is provided on an "as-is" basis. While we strive to keep the bot running smoothly, there is no guarantee of availability or functionality. **cweeper** (Discord Bot Owner) will not be liable for any loss, damage, or inconvenience resulting from the use or inability to use the bot or its services.

## 9. Availability  
While the service aims to provide 24/7 uptime, its availability depends on server and hosting resources. There is no guaranteed uptime, and the bot may experience downtime due to maintenance or other issues.

## 10. Updates and Changes  
The ToS may be updated from time to time. It is the user’s responsibility to check the latest version of the ToS. No direct notifications will be sent regarding updates; the latest version will always be available within this document.

## 11. Jurisdiction  
No specific jurisdiction governs these Terms of Service. The bot is offered globally without adherence to any specific regional laws.

## 12. Termination of Access  
No user will be banned or restricted from using the bot. However, server owners may remove the bot at their discretion. The bot owner might also manually remove the bot from any servers if required.
